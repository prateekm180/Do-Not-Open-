# 💬 We’re Sorry You Feel That Way

We apologize if this repository caused:
- Confusion
- Frustration
- Doubt
- A deep sigh followed by closing your eyes

However, we would like to clarify that:
- The warning was clear
- You ignored it
- That part is on you

This project was never meant to be helpful, intuitive, or pleasant.

It was meant to exist, and now it does.


If something here made you uncomfortable, annoyed, or question your life choices —

that means the system is functioning correctly.


If you learned something today, that was accidental.

If you suffered, that was expected.


Once again, sorry you feel this way.

While we regret that you feel this way, we do not regret the decisions that led here.

By continuing to read, scroll, clone, fork, or think about this repository, you agree that:
- No promises were made
- No expectations should have existed
- This outcome was predictable

Thank you for your patience & understanding.
- You will not get it back
- And We will not be taking questions at this time.
