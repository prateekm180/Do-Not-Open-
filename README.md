# ⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT OPEN
- Seriously. Don’t.
- This repository exists against the advice of designers, engineers, psychologists, and probably God
(You opened it. That’s on you.)

- This repository contains experimental interfaces that actively disrespect your time, patience, and muscle memory.
- This is a collection of intentionally terrible ideas that take simple problems and solve them in the most complicated, frustrating, and unnecessary way possible.

Think:

- Turning a volume slider into a boss fight
- Replacing buttons with emotional suffering
- Ignoring UX best practices like they personally offended me

This repository is a container.

Inside it, there will be sub-repositories.

Inside those, there will be bad decisions

🎮 Why Does This Exist?
- Because someone once said:
- “It’s just a simple feature.”
- And that felt like a challenge.


❓ What Is This Abomination?

- Do Not Open is a meta-repository containing multiple sub-repositories, each dedicated to an idea that should have been stopped in a meeting — but wasn’t.
- Every project here answers the same question:

- “What if we made a simple task… deeply upsetting?”
- "Why finding optimal solutions when you can (make other) suffer for it? and share some 🧠 Cognitive & Emotional Damage"
