🚫 DO NOT OPEN
Seriously. Don’t.
This repository exists against the advice of designers, engineers, psychologists, and probably God
(You opened it. That’s on you.)












⚠️ WARNING
This repository contains experimental interfaces that actively disrespect your time, patience, and muscle memory.

❓ What Is This Abomination?

Do Not Open is a meta-repository containing multiple sub-repositories, each dedicated to an idea that should have been stopped in a meeting — but wasn’t.

Every project here answers the same question:

“What if we made a simple task… deeply upsetting?”

🔊 Why Is Volume Control So Hard Here?

Because sliders are cowards.

Inside this repository you may encounter:

🎮 Gamified Volume Control

Why adjust volume when you can suffer for it?

Pong Volume Control
Your volume is tied to your skill.
You are bad at Pong.
Enjoy silence.

Angry Birds Slingshot Volume
Pull back. Release. Miss the target.
Congratulations, your ears lose.

Curling Simulator
Physics-based volume adjustment.
The stone stopped somewhere.
That’s your volume now. Deal with it.

🧠 Cognitive & Emotional Damage

Interfaces designed to gatekeep functionality:

Math Exam Before Volume Change
+1 volume requires solving equations.
Fail once → difficulty increases out of spite.

Clippy Spelling Challenge
Spell the number you want.
Clippy will interrupt.
You cannot mute Clippy.

Launch the Slider 300 Metres
Click slider → it escapes the UI.
You must retrieve it like a lost child.

🧱 Absurd Physical Interfaces

Because realism was a mistake:

Seesaw Volume Control
Balance UI elements until the volume feels “right.”
No indicators. No explanation. Only vibes.

Voice Control (Exact Yelling Edition)
Shout at precisely the correct decibel level.
Humans are not calibrated instruments.
Failure is guaranteed.
